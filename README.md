# KingdomOfEther - A Kingdom on the Ethereum Blockchain

This smart contract creates a virtual kingdom on the EVM blockchain, where individuals can become the monarch by claiming the throne through a bidding process. The contract also has a commission system and allows the contract owner to sweep accumulated fees. The contract owner can pause the contract to prevent new monarch claims.

## Features

1. **Become the Monarch**: Anyone can become the monarch by calling the `becomeMonarch` function and paying the current claim price. The person who pays the highest price becomes the new monarch.

2. **Commission System**: A commission is deducted from the claim price each time a new monarch is crowned. This commission is accumulated as fees for the contract owner.

3. **Monarch Renouncement**: The current monarch can renounce their throne by calling the `renounceMonarchy` function, and the contract owner becomes the new monarch.

4. **Pausing the Contract**: The contract owner has the ability to pause and unpause the contract using the `pauseContract` and `unpauseContract` functions, respectively.

5. **Contract Management**: Only the contract owner and the current monarch have specific privileges to certain functions to ensure the integrity of the kingdom.

## Functions

Here are the main functions of the KingdomOfEther contract:

- `becomeMonarch(bytes32 name) external payable`: Call this function to become the monarch by paying the current claim price and providing a name. The claim price is set by the current monarch and increases over time.

- `renounceMonarchy() external`: Call this function to renounce the throne if you are the current monarch. The contract owner will become the new monarch.

- `getCurrentMonarchName() external view returns (bytes32)`: Get the name of the current monarch.

- `getCurrentReignDuration() external view returns (uint256)`: Get the duration of the current monarch's reign.

- `getAccumulatedFees() external view returns (uint256)`: Get the total accumulated fees that can be swept by the contract owner.

## Important Note
